        HTML was originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. He is also known as the father of the web.
        In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) became the authority to maintain the HTML specifications. HTML also became an international standard (ISO) in 2000. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.
        HTML5 provides a faster and more robust approach to web development.
        HTML5 is the fifth version of the HTML scripting language.
        It supports a lot of new things that older versions of HTML does not.
        For Example: In HTML5 there is something new called the Semantic Elements.
        Semantic elements have meaningful names which tell about the type of content. 
        For example header, footer, table, â€¦ etc. HTML5 introduces many semantic elements which make the code easier to write and understand for the developer as well as instructs the browser on how to treat them.
